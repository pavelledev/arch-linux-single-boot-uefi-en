# Arch Linux Single Boot (UEFI)

## Disclaimers:
This guide is intended for users who are new to Linux. It may not be the most advanced or minimal method, but it will help you install a fully functional Arch Linux system with the essential components most people usually need.

The guide works for both laptops and desktops. Laptop users only have one extra step: connecting to a Wi-Fi network.

**Important:** Linux commands are powerful. A single typo can cause the installation to fail. Please read carefully and type exactly as shown.

All commands are provided in separate code blocks. If a command changes, it will appear in its own new block to avoid confusion.


## Tips

### Using Tab Completion
Most Linux commands support Tab completion:

- Type the beginning of a command or filename.
- Press `TAB` to auto-complete it.
- If multiple matches exist, press `TAB` twice to show all possible completions, or press `TAB` repeatedly to cycle through the suggestions.

This helps prevent mistakes and speeds up the installation process. Note that not all commands support Tab completion.
